# Dice-Roll
The player will roll two dice. If the sum is 2,3,, or 12 (called craps), you lose; if 
the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win. If the sum is another value (i.e., 4,5,6,8,9, or 10.),
a point is awarded. Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled.
If a 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise you win. The program also asks the user if they want to run
the program again.
